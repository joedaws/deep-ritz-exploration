# Deep Ritz Explorations

This repo contains some explorations in the 
[deep ritz method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00211) for
solving pde. 

# the neurnal network drrnn
In the models directory a network class called
drrnn is defined. These networks have the architecture 
outlined in the original work. The implementaiton is in 
pytorch

# TO DO 
* Create custom loss functions
* properly sample from the boundary
